# LeetCode Problems

Welcome to my **LeetCode Problems** repository! This repo contains my personal solutions to problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), aimed at improving problem-solving skills and mastering data structures and algorithms.

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized by problem names and/or numbers. Each folder or file typically contains:
- ✅ A clearly named solution file (e.g., `two_sum.py`)
- 🧠 A brief problem description or link to the original problem
- 📌 My approach and logic (in comments or README, if added)
- ⏱️ Efficient time and space complexity where possible

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- Java ☕ (for selected problems)
- C++ (occasionally)

> Main language: **Java**

## 🚀 Goals

- Practice regularly on LeetCode
- Cover top topics for technical interviews:
  - Arrays & Strings
  - HashMaps & HashSets
  - Sliding Window
  - Recursion & Backtracking
  - Trees & Graphs
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Stacks & Queues
  - Binary Search

## 📊 Progress

I aim to solve problems across three levels:

| Difficulty | Count |
|------------|-------|
| Easy       | ✅ In Progress |
| Medium     | ✅ In Progress |
| Hard       | 🔜 Upcoming |
